**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Support both STDIO and HTTP transports based on a command line argument"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an MCP client developer, I want to run the LoggerUsage.Mcp server with either STDIO or HTTP transport based on a command line argument, so that I can integrate the server into different environments and toolchains that support different MCP transport mechanisms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the LoggerUsage.Mcp server is started with `--transport stdio` command line argument, **When** an MCP client connects via STDIO (stdin/stdout), **Then** the server responds to MCP protocol requests correctly
2. **Given** the LoggerUsage.Mcp server is started with `--transport http` command line argument, **When** an MCP client connects via HTTP, **Then** the server responds to HTTP requests at the configured endpoint
3. **Given** the LoggerUsage.Mcp server is started without any transport argument, **When** the server initializes, **Then** it defaults to HTTP transport (current behavior)
4. **Given** the LoggerUsage.Mcp server is started with an invalid transport argument, **When** the server initializes, **Then** it logs a clear error message and exits gracefully

### Edge Cases
- What happens when both STDIO and HTTP transport configurations are present?
- How does the server handle connection failures for the selected transport?
- How are configuration values from appsettings.json merged with command-line arguments?
- Can the transport be changed at runtime (answer: No, it's a startup configuration)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a `--transport` command line argument with values `stdio` or `http`
- **FR-002**: System MUST configure STDIO transport when `--transport stdio` is provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST configure HTTP transport when `--transport http` is provided (existing behavior)
- **FR-004**: System MUST default to HTTP transport when no `--transport` argument is provided
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate the transport argument value and reject invalid values
- **FR-006**: System MUST log the selected transport mode during startup
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all existing MCP server functionality regardless of transport choice
- **FR-008**: Command-line argument MUST override appsettings.json configuration if both are present

### Key Entities
- **TransportMode**: Enum representing the transport type (STDIO or HTTP)
- **CommandLineConfiguration**: Configuration binding for the `--transport` argument
- **MCP Server**: The existing MCP server that needs to support both transports

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
