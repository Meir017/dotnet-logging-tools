   - Analysis timeout support
   - Bridge communication error recovery
   - Concurrent analysis prevention
   - Missing dependency detection
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Output channel logging

2. **Full Workflow Completion** (11 skipped tests)
   - Auto-analysis on activation
   - Tree view implementation
   - Webview insights panel
   - Filter application
   - Navigate to insight
   - Problems panel (diagnostics)
   - Export functionality
   - Status bar updates
   - Search functionality

3. **Incremental Analysis** (10 tests)
   - File save watching
   - Single-file re-analysis
   - Debouncing rapid saves
   - State preservation for unchanged files
   - Configuration respect (autoAnalyzeOnSave)
   - Tree view & diagnostics updates
   - Progress feedback
   - File deletion handling
   - .csproj change detection

4. **Multi-Solution Support** (11 tests)
   - Solution detection (all .sln files)
   - Default active solution
   - Solution picker UI
   - Solution switching
   - Re-analysis on switch
   - Solution-specific data isolation
   - Tree view & diagnostics per solution
   - Active solution from editor file
   - Nested directory support
   - Solution count in status bar

## Key Changes to Extension

### New Files Created

**Providers (UI Components)**:
- `LoggerTreeViewProvider.ts` - Hierarchical tree view
- `InsightsPanelProvider.ts` - Webview panel
- `DiagnosticsProvider.ts` - Problems panel integration

**State Management**:
- `InsightsState.ts` - Per-file insights storage
- `SolutionState.ts` - Active solution tracking

**Services**:
- `ExportService.ts` - JSON/CSV/Markdown export
- `analysisEvents.ts` - Event emitter for analysis lifecycle

**Utilities**:
- `dotnetDetector.ts` - .NET SDK detection
- `solutionDetector.ts` - Find all solutions in workspace
- `debounce.ts` - Debounce utility
- `logger.ts` - Output channel logging

**Bridge Updates**:
- `WorkspaceAnalyzer.AnalyzeFile()` - Single-file analysis method
- Error codes and structured error responses

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites from Parent Feature

The following must be complete from 001-a-vscode-extension:
- âœ… Extension activation and command registration
- âœ… Basic analysis service (bridge communication)
- âœ… Configuration system
- âœ… Bridge project (LoggerUsage.VSCode.Bridge)
- âœ… Basic models and DTOs

### External Dependencies

- VS Code 1.85+
- .NET 10 SDK
- LoggerUsage library
- LoggerUsage.MSBuild

---

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Test Infrastructure (3 tasks) - Helpers and fixtures
2. **Phase 2**: Full Workflow (21 tasks) - UI components and features
3. **Phase 3**: Error Handling (15 tasks) - Robust error handling
4. **Phase 4**: Incremental Analysis (10 tasks) - File watching and state
5. **Phase 5**: Multi-Solution (10 tasks) - Multiple solution support
6. **Phase 6**: Test Completion (5 tasks) - Enable and verify tests
7. **Phase 7**: Documentation (4 tasks) - Update docs and changelog

**Total**: 68 tasks over ~13-18 days

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Feature is complete when:
- [ ] All 68 tasks in tasks.md completed
- [ ] All 43 integration tests passing (0 skipped)
- [ ] Extension installable and functional
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Incremental analysis < 2s for single file
- [ ] Multi-solution switching works
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## How to Use This Feature Spec

1. **Understand scope**: Read this README and plan.md
2. **Review tests**: Check integration test files to see what needs to pass
3. **Follow tasks**: Work through tasks.md sequentially or pick [P] tasks for parallel work
4. **Test frequently**: Run integration tests after implementing features
5. **Update docs**: Mark tasks complete, update this README

## Related Issues

- See integration test files in `test/LoggerUsage.VSCode.Tests/integration/`
- Each test contains TODO comments describing expected behavior

---

## Architecture Notes

This feature maintains the architecture from parent feature 001:
- TypeScript extension + C# bridge
- Event-driven UI updates
- State management pattern for insights and solutions
- VS Code API best practices

New patterns introduced:
- EventEmitter for analysis lifecycle
- Per-file insights storage (Map<filePath, insights[]>)
- Active solution model (one at a time)
- Debouncing for file save events
- Output channel for debugging
